        <h2>How to play</h2>
        <p>
          You play as a demon, cooperating with a ghost to destroy the world.
          The ghost is your friend (and is also invincible), so don't spend
          valuable time trying to kill it.
          <b
            >The ghost is your source of power. You have to stay close to it.</b
          >
          If you stray too far from the ghost, your speed and damage will
          gradually decrease until you have no chance against the infinite
          onslaught of enemies.
          <br />
          <br />
          In general, any objects you shoot/drop is good and anything your
          enemies shoot is bad. Except for money, that is.
          <br />
          <br />
          You level up by collecting money bills, which are dropped by certain
          enemies. When you have collected enough money, you get to choose from
          4 different powers to level up. Different powers have different
          playstyles, so try out combinations that fit you well! Over time,
          you'll find all the different enemy types and abilities. They will not
          be handed to you in this help section though, you'll have to find and
          test them yourself.
          <br />
          <br />
          Your goal is to survive as long as possible.
        </p>
        <h2>Controls</h2>
        <p1>
          Move: WASD <br />
          Aim: Mouse pointer <br />
          (Using abilities is automatic) <br />
        </p1>
        <h2>Tips</h2>
        <p>
          - Stay relatively close to the ghost. Straying a bit won't hurt you
          much, but going too far away will be a lot more dangerous.<br />
          - Frozen enemies can't use their abilities.<br />
          - Freezing enemies tends to keep the emojis from bunching up, which
          can be both good and bad.<br />
          - It can be hard to pick up money from enemies sometimes. Double back
          every now and then, and pick up what you missed last time.<br />
          - Present pickups give you a little health back.<br />
